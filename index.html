<p> Your story begins with your mother, the queen. She sat at the black ebony window sewing, watching as snowflakes fell from the sky. She pricked her finger on her needle and three drops of blood from her finger fell onto the snow. She was taken aback by the beauty of the black ebony window frame contrasting against the white snow and her three small blood drops. She then wished she had a daughter just as beautiful. Not long after, she had you - fitting that description perfectly! </p>

<p> How sweet, indeed! Unfortunately for you, your mother passed away shortly after you were born. A year later, your father took another wife. Beautiful she is, and she cannot bear the idea of anyone more beautiful than her! She had a magical mirror on her wall in which she would look into and say "Mirror, Mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?"
 </p>
<br>
<a href="#4" class="button">She is, of course!</a>

<p> But she is only for so long! You kept growing prettier and prettier, and one day when the Queen went up to the mirror and asked it who is the fairest of them all, the mirror replied saying that you, Snow White, is the fairest of them all! The Queen grew with envy ant is consumed her entire being. She then sent out a huntsman to take you to the woods so she may never have to see you again, and to prove you were gone he was to bring back your heart. The huntsman raises his knife at you, and you begin to cry.
</p>
<br>
<a href="#5" class="button">Don't kill me, I will go away!</a>

<p> You were so pretty and kind, he decided to take pity on you. He thought that you will die anyways in the woods. The huntsman kills a boar nearby and takes it back to the Queen pretending it is your heart, and she eats it for dinner thinking it is the last she will ever see of you. Meanwhile, you are terrified of every which animal and sound in the woods and what possibly creeps about! You run, in hopes of finding some sort of solace.

<p>In the morning, you wake up to see there are seven little people sleeping in the beds surrounding you - this must be who lives here! They ask your name and why you are here, and you tell them your story. They sympathize with you, and say that if you cook, clean, knit, sew, and keep the house for them then you shall stay. You must also not let anyone into the house as they work, just in case your stepmother figures out where you are.
<br>
<a href="#7" class="button">It's a deal!</a>

<p>The Queen, believing she ate your heart, is now eager to go ask the mirror again who the fairest of them all is. Knowing all truth, the mirror told the Queen as fair as you are, it is still Snow White who is living in the forest. With anger and jealousy filling her heart yet again, she is going to take matters in her own hands! Totally unsuspecting to her new disguise, she knocks on your door pretending to be selling fine wares.
<br>
<a href="#8" class="button">What fine wares do you have, miss?</a>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<div class="h">
<center>
  <span id="8"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>
<p>Laces of all colours! Tempted by their beauty, you buy one. What a beautiful figure you have, let me fit this lace right to you! The lady exclaims. She barges in and before you know it, she is fitting this lace extremely tightly onto you, so much so that it takes your breath away and you collapse. Not much later, the little people come home and find you passed out on the floor, without a sign of life in you.
<br>
<a href="#9" class="button">...</a>

<div class="h">

<span id="9"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>
<p>After seeing your tight lace, they quickly cut it off you. They warn you that the person who you bought lace from was the Queen in disguise! "Good wares to sell!" you hear again, but this time you know better, and deny her entrance into your home. "That doesn't mean you can't look!" she says, waving a wand in front of your eyes. Tempted by the comb, you agree. As she starts to comb your hair, you start to feel faint...
<br>
<a href="#10" class="button">The comb has been laced with poison!</a>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<div class="h">

  <span id="10"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>
<p>Lucky for you, when the people who live with you came home they identified the comb in you hair as being poisoned. They took it out immediately and figured it was the doings of the Queen. You slowly come to your senses and recall what happened to you. Again, they warn you. But again, the Queen goes home and asked the mirror who the fairest of all is. The mirror replied that you, Snow White, are. She is enraged, and will still do anything to get you out of the way.
<br>
<a href="#11" class="button">I promise to not let anyone in

<p>You hear yet another knock on your door. You pop your head out and explain that you are not allowed to let anyone in. "Alright," the old woman says, "I'll just get rid of my apple elsewhere." She flashes a beautiful sparkling half red half white apple in front of your eyes. You explain again you are not to take anything from strangers, but she insists that the apple is completely fine and that she will cut the apple in half and share it with you. You have the red side, and she has the white.

<p>All of a sudden, you wake up and find yourself in the presence of a Prince. From the transportation of your coffin, you threw up the poison apple. He told you all that happened and said he would like you to be his bride. However, your stepmother was also to be at your wedding. As she got dressed for your wedding, she asked the mirror who the fairest of them all was. The mirror replied that you, the bride, are. She was filled with anger, but she decided to go anyways and recognized you immediately.
